Using with frameworks
*******************************

There are some integrations in library you are not limited to use them.

Built-in frameworks integrations:

* aiohttp
* Flask
* Fastapi
* Litestar
* Starlette
* Aiogram
* Aiogram_dialog
* pyTelegramBotAPI
* Arq
* FastStream
* TaskIq
* Sanic
* grpcio

Common approach
=====================

For several frameworks library contains helper functions so you don't need to control scopes yourself, but just annotate handler/view functions and change application startup code

To use framework integration you mainly need to do 3 things:

* call ``setup_dishka`` on your container and framework entity
* add ``FromDishka[YourClass]`` on you framework handlers (or view-functions)
* decorate your handlers with ``@inject`` before registering them in framework. Some integrations do not required it, see :ref:`autoinject`

.. note::
   ``FromDishka[T]`` is basically a synonym for ``Annotated[T, FromComponent()]`` and is used to get an object from default component. To use other component you can use the same syntax with annotated ``Annotated[T, FromComponent("X")]``.

   For more details on components see :ref:`components`

For FastAPI it will look like:

.. code-block:: python

   from dishka.integrations.fastapi import FromDishka, inject, setup_dishka

   @router.get("/")
   @inject
   async def index(interactor: FromDishka[Interactor]) -> str:
       result = interactor()
       return result

   app = FastAPI()
   container = make_async_container(provider)
   setup_dishka(container, app)


For such integrations library enters scope for each generated event. So if you have standard scope, than handler dependencies will be retrieved as for ``Scope.REQUEST``.

Additionally, you may need to call ``container.close()`` in the end of your application lifecycle if you want to finalize APP-scoped dependencies

.. _autoinject:

Auto injection
=========================

With some frameworks we provide an option to inject dependencies in handlers without decorating them with ``@inject``.

* For **aiogram** you need to provide ``auto_inject=True`` when calling ``setup_dishka``. E.g:

.. code-block:: python

    from dishka.integrations.aiogram import FromDishka, setup_dishka

    @router.message()
    async def start(
        message: Message,
        user: FromDishka[User],
    ):
        await message.answer(f"Hello, {1}, {user.full_name}!")


    setup_dishka(container=container, router=dp, auto_inject=True)

* For **Flask** you need to provide ``auto_inject=True`` when calling ``setup_dishka``. It is important here to call it after registering all views and blueprints. E.g:

.. code-block:: python

    from dishka.integrations.flask import FromDishka, setup_dishka

    @app.get("/")
    def index(
            *,
            interactor: FromDishka[Interactor],
    ) -> str:
        result = interactor()
        return result

    setup_dishka(container=container, app=app, auto_inject=True)

* For **FastAPI** you need to provide ``route_class=DishkaRoute`` when creating ``APIRouter``. E.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    from dishka.integrations.fastapi import FromDishka, DishkaRoute, setup_dishka

    router = APIRouter(route_class=DishkaRoute)

    @router.get("/")
    async def index(
            *,
            interactor: FromDishka[Interactor],
    ) -> str:
        result = interactor()
        return result

    setup_dishka(container, app)

* For **FastStream** (**0.5.0** version and higher) you need to provide ``auto_inject=True`` when calling ``setup_dishka``. E.g:

.. code-block:: python

    from faststream import FastStream
    from faststream.nats import NatsBroker, NatsMessage
    from dishka import make_async_container
    from dishka.integrations.faststream import FastStreamProvider, FromDishka, setup_dishka

    broker = NatsBroker()
    app = FastStream(broker)
    setup_dishka(make_async_container(..., FastStreamProvider), app, auto_inject=True)

    @broker.subscriber("/")
    def index(
            *,
            message: FromDishka[NatsMessage],
    ) -> str:
        await message.ack()
        return message.body

* For **Sanic** you need to provide ``auto_inject=True`` when calling ``setup_dishka``. It is important here to call it after registering all views and blueprints. E.g:

.. code-block:: python

    from sanic import Sanic, Request, HTTPResponse
    from dishka.integrations.sanic import FromDishka, setup_dishka

    app = Sanic(__name__)

    @app.get("/")
    async def index(
        request: Request,
        interactor: FromDishka[Interactor],
    ) -> HTTPResponse:
        return HTTPResponse(interactor())

    setup_dishka(container=container, app=app, auto_inject=True)

Context data
====================

As ``REQUEST`` scope is entered automatically you cannot pass context data directly, but integrations do it for you:

These objects are passed to context:

* aiohttp - ``aiohttp.web_request.Request``
* Flask - ``flask.Request``
* Fastapi - ``fastapi.Request`` or ``fastapi.WebSocket`` if you are using web sockets
* Litestar - ``litestar.Request``
* Starlette - ``starlette.requests.Request`` or ``starlette.websockets.WebSocket`` if you are using web sockets
* Aiogram - ``aiogram.types.TelegramObject``
* pyTelegramBotAPI - actual type of event (like ``Message``) is used.
* Arq - no objects
* FastStream - ``faststream.broker.message.StreamMessage`` or ``faststream.[broker].[Broker]Message``, ``faststream.utils.ContextRepo`` 
* TaskIq - no objects
* Sanic - ``sanic.request.Request``
* grpcio - ``grpcio.ServicerContext`` to get the current context and ``google.protobuf.message.Message`` to get the current request

To use such objects you need to declare them in your provider using :ref:`from-context` and then they will be available as factories params.

Websocket support
=============================

Injection is working with webosckets in these frameworks:

* FastAPI
* Starlette
* aiohttp

For most cases we operate single events like HTTP-requests. In this case we operate only 2 scopes: ``APP`` and ``REQUEST``. Websockets are different: for one application you have multiple connections (one per client) and each connection delivers multiple messages. To support this we use additional scope: ``SESSION``:

    ``APP`` |rarr| ``SESSION`` |rarr| ``REQUEST``

In frameworks like FastAPI and Starlette your view function is called once per connection and then you retrieve messages in loop. So, ``inject`` decorator can be only used to retrieve SESSION-scoped objects. To achieve REQUEST-scope you can enter in manually:

.. code-block:: python

    @inject
    async def get_with_request(
        websocket: WebSocket,
        a: FromDishka[A],  # object with Scope.SESSION
        container: FromDishka[AsyncContainer],  # container for Scope.SESSION
    ) -> None:
        await websocket.accept()
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            # enter the nested scope, which is Scope.REQUEST
            async with container() as request_container:
                b = await request_container.get(B)  # object with Scope.REQUEST

This is how it works with aiohttp

.. code-block:: python

    @inject
    async def get_with_request(
        request: web.Request, 
        a: FromDishka[A],  # object with Scope.SESSION
        container: FromDishka[AsyncContainer],  # container for Scope.SESSION
    ) -> web.WebsocketResponse:
        websocket = web.WebsocketResponse()
        await websocket.prepare(request)

        async for message in weboscket:
            # enter the nested scope, which is Scope.REQUEST
            async with container() as request_container:
                b = await request_container.get(B)  # object with Scope.REQUEST

Adding integrations
===========================

Though there are some integrations in library you are not limited to use them.

The main points are:

1. Find a way to pass a global container instance. Often it is attached to application instance or passed by a middleware.
2. Find a place to enter request scope and how to pass it to a handler. Usually, it is entered in a middleware and container is stored in some kind of request context.
3. Configure a decorator. The main option here is to provide a way for retrieving container. Often, need to modify handler signature adding additional parameters. It is also available.
4. Check if you can apply decorator automatically.

While writing middlewares and working with scopes is done by your custom code, we have a helper for creating ``@inject`` decorators - a ``wrap_injection`` function.

* ``container_getter`` is a function with two params ``(args, kwargs)`` which is called to get a container used to retrieve dependencies within scope.
* ``additional_params`` is a list of ``inspect.Parameter`` which should be added to handler signature.

For more details, check existing integrations.
