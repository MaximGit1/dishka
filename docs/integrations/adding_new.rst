Adding new integrations
===========================

Though there are some integrations in library you are not limited to use them.

The main points are:

1. Find a way to pass a global container instance. Often it is attached to application instance or passed by a middleware.
2. Find a place to enter request scope and how to pass it to a handler. Usually, it is entered in a middleware and container is stored in some kind of request context.
3. Configure a decorator. The main option here is to provide a way for retrieving container. Often, need to modify handler signature adding additional parameters. It is also available.
4. Check if you can apply decorator automatically.

While writing middlewares and working with scopes is done by your custom code, we have a helper for creating ``@inject`` decorators - a ``wrap_injection`` function.

* ``container_getter`` is a function with two params ``(args, kwargs)`` which is called to get a container used to retrieve dependencies within scope.
* ``additional_params`` is a list of ``inspect.Parameter`` which should be added to handler signature.

For more details, check existing integrations.
